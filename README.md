## Gophing Around

These are a some small projects and exercises to learn Go and many of it's important packages.  

The folders are as follows:   
1. `exercism`: My set of solutions to the exercism exercises in Go.  
2. `HTMLParser`: Extracts links from HTML files and outputs them with their text.   
3. `SiteMap`: Builds a site map of a website, using the HTML Parser to parse links from eac individual page.        

Open to PRs if these can be improved in any way!
